    "## TOPIC: Structured Data in Text Files\n",
    "**What is it?**\n",
    "It's like turning a boring .txt file into your mini spreadsheet 📋—but in code! You’re storing info (like user name, age, email, etc.) in a consistent, structured way, just like in a table or database. No need for Excel or SQL—just pure Python & text files!\n",
    "## 💡 Core Concept\n",
    "You’re treating a `.txt` file like a baby database—adding, reading, editing, deleting user info record by record, each on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Basics of Structured Storage\n",
    "* Format the data: Decide how your data is separated—comma, colon, or key=value.\n",
    "Example:  `Ahmad,21,ahmad@gmail.com` or `name=Ahmad:age=21:email=ahmad@gmail.com`\n",
    "* Keep it consistent for easier reading and splitting later.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  3.2 Writing Records to File\n",
    "* Save one full record per line.\n",
    "* Use join() or f-strings to format data:\n",
    "`f\"{name},{age},{email}\\n\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Reading Records\n",
    "* Read lines using `.readlines()` or a `for loop`.\n",
    "* Remove the \\n using `.strip()`.\n",
    "* Break it down using `.split(',')` to get individual fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  3.4 Displaying Data\n",
    "* Show all records in a clean table.\n",
    "* Use f-strings for neat column formatting.\n",
    "* Add serial numbers to records.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  3.5 Searching Records\n",
    "* Take input and check if it exists using \"in\" keyword.\n",
    "* Allow partial matches and ignore case using .lower().\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Updating Records\n",
    "* Load all lines into a list.\n",
    "* Find the record using a unique field (e.g., name).\n",
    "* Change values → overwrite file.\n",
    "* Optional: Backup old data before saving new.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7  Deleting Records\n",
    "* Load all records.\n",
    "* Remove the one you don’t want.\n",
    "* Write the rest back into the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 Sorting Records\n",
    "Use Python’s sorted() with lambda to sort by any field.\n",
    "Either display sorted or save it back to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.9 Input Validation & Error Handling\n",
    "* Validate before saving:\n",
    "* Age must be a number.\n",
    "* Email must have @.\n",
    "* Use try-except to avoid crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.10 CLI App (Optional Mini Project)\n",
    "Create a complete command-line app with options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Copy code\n",
    "* 1. Add User\n",
    "* 2. View Users\n",
    "* 3. Search User\n",
    "* 4. Edit User\n",
    "* 5. Delete User\n",
    "* 6. Exit\n",
    "Store everything in a single file like users.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Bonus Python Methods You’ll Use:\n",
    "File: open(), read(), write(), writelines()\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings: split(), join(), strip(), lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "Others: sorted(), enumerate(), os.path.exists(), try-except"
